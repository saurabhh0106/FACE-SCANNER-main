This project involved building a real-time face scanner using OpenCV and NumPy in Google Colab. 
The primary goal was to detect and track human faces in real-time using a webcam feed or pre-recorded video input. OpenCV was utilized for image processing.
while NumPy facilitated matrix operations essential for efficient computations.

Key Features:

Face Detection:

Utilized Haar Cascade Classifier from OpenCV to detect faces in images and video streams.
The model efficiently identified face boundaries with high accuracy.
Image Processing with NumPy:

NumPy was used to manipulate pixel arrays for pre-processing, such as grayscale conversion and resizing.
Visualization:

Detected faces were highlighted using bounding boxes for clear identification.
Displayed results directly in Colab using OpenCV's rendering tools.
